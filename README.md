This Twine Narrative that I have created is in hopes that my reader can get a better understanding of some of the major figures during the time of the Tudor era. Specifically, I took a deep dive into the world of Anne Boleyn and the life she had leading up to her death. The way that I constructed it was so that it felt like a story you were reading along with and getting fact-based knowledge about some things that are not always easy to come by because this era is filled with many questions about what is fact and what might be an embellishment of the truth. I worked to integrate the skills I have on a research-based level, with my short list of skills so far learned from this class to create a factual story filled with interactive elements that I would love to have when learning about history as well as to keep interested. My hope is for the reader to have fun while learning about Anne and her group growing up, and to want to continue to learn about her even after finishing my story.
